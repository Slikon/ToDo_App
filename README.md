# ToDo_App
ToDo_App is a simple To-Do Application, that is also my first training Node.js project.
Write new task into the input line, click 'Add item' button and that's all! Click on the element in a list to delete it.  

## About the project
This project was created after completing the Node.js course [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp)
Some technologies used here may be not so useful nowadays (or even deprecated), as the tutorial I was following is 4 years old.

## Technological stack
Node.js
MongoDB - database
EJS - view engine
Express - server
